# Pool Testing Robot

This robot drives around the edge of a pool and checks the chlorine level using a color sensor and test strips. It has two arms: one that lowers the sensor and test strip into the water, and another that adds chlorine if needed. An ESP32-CAM takes a picture of the test strip for documentation. It's powered by an Arduino and runs on tank drive.

## Why I Built This

I built this project to automate the annoying process of checking pool chlorine levels. I wanted something that could detect low chlorine and fix the problem on its own. Plus, it gave me a chance to work with CAD, sensors, Arduino, and robotic arms â€” all stuff I like.
