Pool Chlorine Robot

What I'm Building:
My plan is to design a robot that automates the task of checking your pool's chlorine levels and adding chlorine to the pool. 
First off, the robot drives up to the edge of the pool. It knows when it stop because the sensor on the front dectecs when the depth of the ground beneath the robot changes. 
Next, the 1st arm of the robot grabs a chlorine strip tester and dips it into the pool. The camera mounted above the axle of the arm will observe the strip. 
Depending on the color of the strip, the robot will decide whether or not to dump chlorine into the pool. 
If it doesn't need chlorine, the robot will pace the strip into the mounded trashcan and drive back to it's orginal parking spot. 
If the pool needs chlorine, the robot will still place the strip into the trash can, but now its going to send a signal to the second arm. 
The second arm will grab the chlorine bottle thats sitting on the designated spot ontop of the robot. It will move the bottle so that its now above the pool. 
Then it will flip the bottle upside down. Next, the upper part of the arm will unscrew the cap and the chlorine will be dumped into the pool. 
Now, the arm will bring the bottle to the trashcan and then the robot will drive back to its designated spot. 

Day 1 7/13/25:
This is the first day that I started my project. I only have 2.5 weeks to submit my designs so I started working. 
First off, before I cadded anything, I designed what I wanted my robot to look like on paper first. I drew different angles of it to referance for my CAD model later. Heres my original design:
